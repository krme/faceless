<p>We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a <code>p</code> element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look <em>awesome</em>, not awful.</p>
<p>The <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> plugin is our attempt to give you what you <em>actually</em> want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.</p>
<p>It adds a new <code>prose</code> class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:</p>

<h2>What to expect from here on out</h2>
<p>What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like <strong>bold text</strong>, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, <em>and even italics</em>.</p>
<p>It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>We want everything to look good out of the box.</li>
    <li>Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.</li>
    <li>Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we're going to try out another header style.</p>
<h3>Typography should be easy</h3>
<p>So that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>Something a wise person once told me about typography is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.</p></blockquote>
